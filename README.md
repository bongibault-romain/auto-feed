# AutoFeed

This plugin allows players to automatically feed when hungry. The `AutoFeed` plugin simplifies player hunger management by allowing them to automatically feed when their hunger level is low, helping them stay healthy and avoid hunger-related deaths.

## Installation

Put the plugin in your `plugins` folder and restart your server.

## Usage

Put food in your inventory, as soon as your food level drops enough (to avoid wasting) the food will be consumed wherever it is in your inventory.
